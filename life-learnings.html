    <h1>My Learnings</h1>
    <p>Never say never, just do it.</p>
    <p>Never compromise your self respect.</p>
    <p>Always say truth, to avoid problems later on.</p>
    <p>Always be the kind of person you wanted to meet.</p>
    <p>Smile to change the  world, never let the world ever change your smile.</p>
    <p>Don't be very serious about your thoughts, at the end it's just a thought.</p>
    <p>Don't be fear failure, but be terrified of regrets.</p>
